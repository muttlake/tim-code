# What is a stage build ?
# The ability to run a peice of code when you don't need anything
# In Jenkins pipeline, you only deployed just the application
# We do not need to attach to application the build tools
# We need aspnetcore to create application
# but we only need runtime to deploy.

#Here we install runtime
